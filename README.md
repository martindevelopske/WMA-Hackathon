This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Wikidata Queries

The following Wikidata queries are used to fetch relevant data for this project. Developers and contributors can refer to them for better understanding and debugging.

1. Finding Actors Who Have Worked Together
The following SPARQL query retrieves actors who have shared roles in multiple works with a specified actor.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
-  Replace Q40096 with the Wikidata ID of the target actor.

-  The query searches for works they performed in and finds other    actors who were in the same productions.

-  It excludes the original actor and only lists those who appeared in more than one shared work.

-  Optional fields: Retrieves actor names, descriptions, and images for better clarity.

#... Query ...#

SELECT DISTINCT 
  ?actorY 
  ?actorYLabel 
  ?actorYDescription
  ?image
  (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?sharedWorks) 
WHERE {
  # Replace Q40096 with the Wikidata ID of your actor X
  VALUES ?actorX { wd:Q40096 }
  
  # Find works that actor X has performed in
  ?work wdt:P161 ?actorX.
  
  # Find other actors who performed in the same works
  ?work wdt:P161 ?actorY.
  
  # Exclude actor X themselves
  FILTER(?actorY != ?actorX)
  
  # Get optional image
  OPTIONAL { ?actorY wdt:P18 ?image. }
  
  # Get labels and descriptions
  SERVICE wikibase:label { 
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". 
    ?actorY rdfs:label ?actorYLabel .
    ?actorY schema:description ?actorYDescription .
  }
}
GROUP BY ?actorY ?actorYLabel ?actorYDescription ?image
# Only show actors who shared more than one work
HAVING (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) > 1)
ORDER BY DESC(?sharedWorks)

2. Fetching Movies Featuring Two Actors
This JavaScript class enables querying the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint to retrieve movies or TV shows featuring two specified actors.

ðŸ“Œ How It Works:
-  Replace Q2263 and Q167498 with the Wikidata IDs of the actors you want to compare.

-  The query searches for movies (Q11424) or TV shows (Q5398426) where both actors appeared.

-  It retrieves movie details, including:

   - Title & Description

   - Images (Poster & Logo)

   - Publication Date

   - Wikipedia Article (if available)


# SPARQL Query

SELECT DISTINCT 
  ?movie ?movieLabel 
  ?description
  ?image
  ?logo
  ?wikipediaArticle
  ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  # Replace Q2263 and Q167498 with your actor Wikidata IDs
  VALUES ?actor1 { wd:Q2263 }  # First actor
  VALUES ?actor2 { wd:Q167498 }  # Second actor
  
  # Find works that feature both actors
  ?movie wdt:P161 ?actor1, ?actor2.
  
  # Filter for movies (Q11424) or TV series (Q5398426)
  { ?movie wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 } UNION  # Movies
  { ?movie wdt:P31 wd:Q5398426 }      # TV shows
  
  # Get optional properties
  OPTIONAL { ?movie wdt:P18 ?image. }       # Main image
  OPTIONAL { ?movie wdt:P154 ?logo. }       # Logo image
  OPTIONAL { ?movie wdt:P577 ?publicationDate. }  # Publication date
  OPTIONAL { 
    ?movie schema:description ?description. 
    FILTER(LANG(?description) = "en") 
  }
  OPTIONAL {
    ?wikipediaArticle schema:about ?movie;
                     schema:isPartOf <https://en.wikipedia.org/>;
                     schema:name ?articleName.
  }
  
  SERVICE wikibase:label { 
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en". 
  }
}
ORDER BY DESC(?publicationDate)
LIMIT 100

3. Fetching Actors Who Appeared in Two Movies/TV Shows
   
   Overview
     This SPARQL query retrieves actors who have performed in two specific movies or TV shows from Wikidata. It helps identify common cast members between two works.

    SPARQL Query Explanation

-   Replace Q83495 and Q15732802 with the Wikidata IDs of the movies or TV shows.

-   It finds actors who performed in both works.

-   Retrieves details such as:

    -   Name & Description

    -   Profile Image (if available)

    - Number of Shared Works

# SPARQL Query

SELECT DISTINCT ?actor ?actorLabel ?actorDescription ?image (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) AS ?sharedWorks) WHERE {
  # Replace QXXXX and QYYYY with your movie/TV show Wikidata IDs
  VALUES ?work { wd:Q83495 wd:Q15732802 }  # The two movies/TV shows
  
  # Find actors in these works
  ?work wdt:P161 ?actor.
  
  # Get actor details
  OPTIONAL { ?actor wdt:P18 ?image. }
  SERVICE wikibase:label { 
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". 
    ?actor rdfs:label ?actorLabel .
    ?actor schema:description ?actorDescription .
  }
}
GROUP BY ?actor ?actorLabel ?actorDescription ?image
HAVING (COUNT(DISTINCT ?work) = 2)  # Must appear in both works
ORDER BY ?actorLabel
